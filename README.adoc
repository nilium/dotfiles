dotfiles
========

To install these using the Makefile, use bmake.

The following targets are available:

install-vim::
    Vim config files
install-tmux::
    Tmux config files (Darwin/Linux)
install-git::
    Git config (really, really specific to me)

By default, all three are installed.


Subtrees
--------

For working with subtrees in the repo, you can stick the line
`[include] path = ../subtrees.gitconfig` into .git/config and this will provide
quick access to repositories for those subtrees. subtrees.gitconfig should
contain enough information to reproduce the entire set of subtrees in the event
that they need to be rebuilt.

For example, to echo commands to rebuild all subtrees, you could try doing
something like the following:

----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
conf() {
        git config -f subtrees.gitconfig --get-regexp '^remote\..*\.'"$1"'$' | cut -d' ' -f2
}

paste <(conf subtree) <(conf url) <(conf ref) | tr '\t' '\n' |
        xargs -n3 bash -c 'echo git subtree --prefix="$1" --squash "$2" "$3"' _
----

Since the refs are likely to rot, however, using master in place of the ref in
the subtrees.gitconfig may be preferable, since the config itself is maintained
by hand (and the refs extracted from git log).
